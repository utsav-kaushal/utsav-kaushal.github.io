    So, this section is all about what makes you, well, you. It's a chance to
    share the things that don't necessarily make it onto your CV, but are still
    a big part of who you are. Think about the things you're passionate about,
    the things that make you tick. Are you a foodie who loves trying new
    cuisines? Do you have a secret love of rap music? Or maybe you're a bit of a
    quirky collector, with a fondness for vintage teapots? Whatever it is, this
    is your space to let your personality shine through. By sharing these
    personal bits and bobs, you can add a bit of depth and character to your
    profile, and give others a sense of what it's like to hang out with you.

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Lists some Hobbies and Interests</li>
        This could be a good section to talk about your interests and hobbies
        outside what's "relevant in your field." Perhaps talk about basketball
        or hip hop or singing, whatever.
        <br><br>

        <li>Could be just about anything</li>
        Use this section to reflect upon your "personality." Education and
        knowledge is great, but it's not a complete picture of "who you are."
        <br><br>

        <li>They already have your CV and your linkedin</li>
        If someone is reading this page, it's very likely they've already gone
        through your linkedin and your resume/cv (infact you could link this
        site on there), but anyways - they already know you as a professional.
        Exploring this page, they may want to know more about you as a person sp
        do that.
        <br><br>

        <li>Link interests with experience</li>
        You could also be a bit cheaky and talk about your interests in a way
        that reflect better with your experience. use the html a tag to add
        hyperlinks, should that help
    </ol>


    <h2>Life Goals</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Could be just goals for 2025, if not for whole life</li>

        <li>Change heading or these texts according to your structure</li>

        <li>Or Follow above style</li>
        And have a section for each heading. or mix match
    </ol>
